Voices in the Mist
Genre: Maze-Exploration Adventure
Platform: PC

 
Summary: Your headlamp lights the way as you sneak past the snoring guard slip into the catacombs. You quickly descend through the floors, running through the passageways you’ve explored a hundred times before. As you reach the blockage preventing any deeper exploration, you see it’s been cleared, and a dim light glows down the tunnel where it had been. As you descend into that tunnel, you enter a place beyond your wildest nightmares. Horrors prey within the mist, not just on your body, but on your mind. Arm yourself with rune weapons from eras past and try to find a way to escape the nightmare. But be careful, as the voices in your head become clearer, you may face fears you never knew you had…

Key Game Features
•       Maze-Exploration Adventure: Players will wander through the catacombs, every step shrouded by mist and darkness. They must be careful though, deeper in the depths lie creeping horrors, and even a flashlight           won’t help you then.
•       Discoverable Runes: Players will be able to discover runes in their explorations of the catacombs. These runes hold the shadow and muscle memory of a weapon, armor piece, or tool buried with a skeleton                entombed within the walls around you. Wield these to keep yourself safe as you search for an exit and an answer to the whispers in the mist.

•       Spear of the Kingsguard: A sword that provides light when equipped, and deals additional Royal damage per hit..

They deal regional debuffs until they are defeated. They will be hard to kill, and require weapons          that deal extra Horror damage.
•       Open World: Explore the maze to find an exit at your own peril. You risk both bodily and mental harm as you venture deeper in the mist.

As your insanity grows, voices will speak to            you in the mist. Are they figments of your imagination? Are they the temptation of an eldritch being? Or is listening to them your best hope at escape?
